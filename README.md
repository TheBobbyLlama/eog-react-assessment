### Bob's Notes:

* I'd only worked a little with GraphQL and barely touched MUI before, so this assessment involved a lot of learning!  I was fortunate that I never got completely stumped.  It was slow going at times, but I made it to the finish line.
* I used Prettier to automatically format on save, but it frequently made the linter unhappy.  What a pain!
* I'm sure there are a lot of opportunities for optimization (like reducing the amount of data points rendered for the graph), but I'm just glad to be done with it.
